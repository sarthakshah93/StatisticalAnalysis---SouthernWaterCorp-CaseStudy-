Case Study Overview:

Southern Water Corp, an Israeli water desalination company, identified that Surjek is the most expensive of the three desalination plants that company operates operates. This is largely due to Surjek’s large cost-base, however, this has
also been driven by higher maintenance costs due to desalination pumps failing. The Engineering Team doesn’t have time to continuously look at data to proactively point out when the pump is failing. They’re
stretched thin in terms of resources and may benefit from a data analyst creating an alarm for them that is able to detect failure on their behalf.

As a Data Analyst, you’ve got to get used to using statistics to tease out insight from your provided data. Most commonly, the data you will be analysing will be time series data.
Time series data is essentially data which is recorded at a specific time. For example, if we were to check the temperature every hour for one day, we’d have 24 unique time
series data points.

In this case study, you will be dealing with minute by minute time-series data. The data will be recorded every minute for a number of variables like temperature. In particular,
you will use each of the descriptive and inferential techniques you learned and reinforce this with analyzing the behavior of a desalination plant pump before failure and during failure.
